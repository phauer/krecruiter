# TODOs

## 2021 digital kkon

## old

- more tests?:
    - check out java testing guide: what else can we test that require special assertions.
    - add a Scheduler - maybe it will email

## low prio

- idea: insert some mistakes in the production code. attendees should find errors by writing tests.
- use term "component test" instead of "integration test"? at least name it once in the slides.
