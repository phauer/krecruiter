# TODOs

## 2021 digital kkon

- restructure to 3x 2h blocks
    - adapt message to participants
- slide 60, "Even Better: Reuse a Single Container" auf postgres umschreiben
- branch mgmt
    - squash and merge this branch to master
    - update branches "part-n"
    - make repo public again
- digital setup
    - can participants share their screen?

## old

- more tests?:
    - check out java testing guide: what else can we test that require special assertions.
    - add a Scheduler - maybe it will email

## low prio

- idea: insert some mistakes in the production code. attendees should find errors by writing tests.
- use term "component test" instead of "integration test"? at least name it once in the slides.
